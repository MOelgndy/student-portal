This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- I've designed this template according to my experience in the previous projects.
- You may find some files useless, if so, remove them after you finish development.
- You can search them in the entire project by this key word (TODO: Remove if unused).

- Adding documentation for your code is more than welcome.

- This project has a single module which is the [src](../src) folder.

- MainFolder: is any direct child folder under [src](../src).

- MainFolder internal structure will be the same as the [pages](../src/pages).

- We handle fonts using [this method](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) from nextJS.
